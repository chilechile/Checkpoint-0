// Strings

/* 
First, declare variable named firstName.
var firstName;
Assign firstName to a string value of your first name.
var firstName = "Alexis";
Declare another variable named lastName and assign it the value of your last name. var lastName = "Montgomery";

Then declare another variable named fullName and assign it to the current value of firstName and lastName and have the joined values separated with a space character.
Remember that computer languages will not add the space character for you so how would you do that manually?
*/ 
var fullName = "Alexis" + "Montgomery"



//Numbers
/*
Declare a variable named luckyNumber.
Assign luckyNumber to a number of your choice.
Declare another variable named luckyNumberTimes2 and assign it the value of luckyNumber multiplied by 2.
*/
var luckyNumber = 21; 
var luckyNumberTimes2 = 42; 

//Booleans
/*
Declare a variable named myBool and assign it the value of true.
Then, declare another named isEqualTo and assign it the value of strictly comparing luckyNumber and luckyNumberTimes2.
*/ var myBool = true
 myVar isEqualtTo = 21 * 2;
